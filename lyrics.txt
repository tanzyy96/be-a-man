Let's get down to business
To outbid the Huns
Here I have some figures
And some facts and sums!

You're the saddest bunch I ever met
But you can bet before we're through
Mister, I'll make a man
Out of you

Be a man
We must be swift as the coursing river
Be a man
With all the force of a great typhoon
Be a man
With all the strength of a raging fire
Mysterious as the dark side of the moon
